## Project 1 (Basic Instagram Card)
Basic Instagram Card is designed inspired from some functionalities of Instagram where one can add a user as a friend and can like his/her Picture by double clicking the photo with a Heart Popping out for some time and vanishing 

Initially the Card displaying the person has status of "Not Friends"

After clicking the Add Friend button the friend status changes as well as the button
